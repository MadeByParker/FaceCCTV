#### FaceCCTV

## Project Description

Aimed for individuals or organisations who want to find out who caused them damage, but donâ€™t have the financial package to buy high quality CCTV Cameras. FaceCCTV is a web-hosted solution where users can upload an image then the app uses deep learning AI to detect the faces in an image and then enhance the faces, which the user can export and use later on. FaceCCTV features a simple user interface through a website, cross-platform desktop app and a mobile app. Images are encrypted through the web server using HTTPS, SSL and AES-256 encryption.
