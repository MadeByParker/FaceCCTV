#### What has been done in the last sprint?

- Gathered data from a 1 hour youtube video of CCTV footage, which was cut into individual frames by using a python library called 'OpenCV'.

- Then went into photoshop and made an CCTV Effect to apply to the frames.

- Made a Photoshop Action to automatically apply said filter.

- Decided on a model.

#### 

#### The model itself

- Using a Deep Learning Model, as it is good for solving complex problems that have hidden patterns in the data, in this case the faces.

#### 

#### Mininum Viable Product

- Should have a usable web app to showcase alongside some code for the AI whether its working or not to show progress.
