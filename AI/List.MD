Prepare the dataset: The WIDER Face dataset contains images and annotations for face detection. download the dataset and extract the images and annotations. The annotations include bounding boxes around the faces in the images. use the annotations to train your CNN to detect faces in new images.

Preprocess the data: Need to preprocess the images before feeding them into the CNN. This can include resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping to increase the diversity of the training data.

Build the CNN: Use a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor and add a few layers on top to classify the features as faces or non-faces. Alternatively, it is possible to train a CNN from scratch using the annotated data. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize the performance of your CNN.

Train the CNN: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Train the CNN on the training set using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss function. Validation set to monitor the performance of the CNN during training and adjust the hyperparameters accordingly. Finally, evaluate the performance of the CNN on the testing set to measure its accuracy and other metrics.

Fine-tune the CNN: fine-tune the CNN by using transfer learning, which involves using a pre-trained CNN on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) as a starting point and then fine-tuning the network on the WIDER Face dataset. This can help to improve the performance of the CNN with less training data.

Deploy the CNN: Once trained the CNN and achieved satisfactory performance, deploy it in a real-world application for face detection. This can involve integrating the CNN with a front-end interface and back-end server to process images in real-time.
