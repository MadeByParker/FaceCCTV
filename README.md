## Before Reading

This repository contains the source code and assets for my Final Year Project at University.

### Research

* Why is the footage on CCTV cameras bad quality? [click here](https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/why-is-the-quality-of-cctv-footage-still-so-low.html)
* Youtube Video explaining why CCTV camera have poor quality. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWCPXJXWum8)
* UK Crime and Safety Statistics [here](https://crimerate.co.uk/#:~:text=The%20crime%20rate%20in%20the,77.49%20crimes%20per%201%2C000%20people.)

### Project Vision:

After doing research on the crime rate percentage and seeing a 1% increase of crimes committed in 2021 from 2020 to approximately 79,000 in the last 12 months and only a 5% of those result in a charge. You wonder why? This is partly due to the poor quality of CCTV, which makes finding the right person more difficult. Adding to this, higher-resolution cameras are on the expensive side which most businesses canâ€™t afford, due to high costs or budget restrictions, resulting in them purchasing lower-resolution CCTV cameras which could lead to poor image quality. If you ever tried to upscale an image, it will become very pixelated and may require photo editing skills to do it professionally, which potentially adds to the costs.

My solution is an app called FaceCCTV, where users can upload an image then the app uses deep learning AI (trained beforehand with a dataset of pre-collected images). the AI can detect the faces in an image and then enhance the faces, which the user can export and use later on. The main goal is to provide a tool that is easy to use and powered by AI to help people identify criminals easier without the unnecessary costs of cameras or professionals.

### List of Project Objectives:

#### Main Objectives:
* Create an AI that can detect faces or bodies of people.
* Once detected, the AI zooms in on the area and enhances it so the user can see clearly.
* Simple User Interface capable of being used by everyone.

#### Side Objectives:

* The AI can identify objects such as car registration plates, car models, locations.
* The AI is optimally developed so there aren't any performance issues.
* The AI should be able to handle any image, in size and resolution.

### Security

* As this project handling with very sensitive data, I am not permitted to allow users store CCTV on my website for later use in case of a data breach or if i had the intent to access the data myself as this could conflict with the rules of the Human Rights Act 1998, 2018 GDPR Regulations and etc... [as stated here](https://www.caughtoncamera.net/news/cctv-legal-requirements-cctv-laws-explained/)
* As users can upload images to the website via a mobile network connection or through WiFi, the images will be encrypted in transit (using AES-256-CBC mode) to ensure that unauthorised parties can't intercept whilst uploading/downloading
