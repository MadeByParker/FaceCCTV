## COMP3000-FaceCCTV

### Welcome to my Final Year Project Github Repository

This repository contains the source code and assets for the COMP3000 Final Year Project by Harry Parker.

### Project Vision:

This Project was carried out to create an AI Facial / Object Recognition Tool for CCTV Cameras that will make a difference in recognising and identifying the correct people. The aim of this project is to make the identification process easier for the police and other security companies so the percentage of misidentification of criminals is reduced.

### List of Project Objectives:

#### Main Objectives:
* Create an AI that can detect faces or bodies of people.
* Once detected, the AI zooms in on the area and enhances it so the user can see clearly.
* Simple User Interface capable of being used by everyone.

#### Side Objectives:

* The AI can identify objects such as car registration plates, car models, locations.
* The AI is optimally developed so there isn't performance issues.
